* Once the synthetic data is generated and loaded, langchain.text_splitter.CharacterTextSplitter.split_documents is used to split the listing's dataset into smaller chunks.
* A chroma database is created using split listings and langchain.embeddings.openai.OpenAIEmbeddings
* A query prompt is created which contains buyers Q&A and instructions for semantic search. 
* 5 most relevant listings are extracted by querying the database with ```chroma.cosine_similarity()```. Example output; From the table above, the 5 most relevant listings were:
Manhattan, San Francisco,Miami, Seattle, Los Angeles. These results make sense, since my preferences were:
  * The listing should have more than 2 bedrooms.
  * 2 very important things are that it should be nearby the beach, a lake, or a river. Must have sunny weather.
  * Should have a terrace and a nice kitchen.
  * Bike friendly, well connected with the highway
  * A balance between suburban tranquility and access to urban amenities like restaurants and theaters.

* Previous listings are used as context, and prompt is input to ```langchain.chains.question_answering.load_qa_chain.run()```. The prompt instructs llm to refine the search by extract the 3 most relevant listings from the context, taking into acoount buyer's preferences.
* LLM is used to augment 3 most relevant listings which were Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles; which make sense regarding my preferences.
* Finally the listings are augmented using llm. The next table compares the listings before and after augmentation:
